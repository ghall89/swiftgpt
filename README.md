#  SwiftGPT

## About

### Story

As an exercise in native macOS development, build an app using the OpenAI API in Swift and SwiftUI. This app should:

1. Allow an end user to enter their OpenAI API key
2. Take in a text prompt
3. Query the OpenAI API
4. Display the result in a list view alongside the user's prompt
5. Retain the user's API key after quitting 

### Stretch Features

1. Store chat history between sessions
2. Allow user to select which OpenAI engine they'd like to use (currently defaults to "curie")

## Installation

As of now, you must have at least macOS 13 Ventura, Xcode 14, and the ability to build the app yourself. I plan to eventually provide a binary download for both Intel and Apple Silicon in the future.

1. Download or clone this repo
2. Open `SwiftGPT.xcodeproj` in Xcode
3. Press the "play" button in the upper left of the window
